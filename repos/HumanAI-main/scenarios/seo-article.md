# Scenario: SEO Article

**Use when:** Humanizing SEO content while preserving keyword intent.

**Pipeline:** Stage 0 (anti-AI cleanup) → Stage 1 (keyword audit) → Stage 2 (structure rebuild) → Stage 3 (specificity) → Stage 4 (human voice) → Stage 5 (SEO polish)

**Default tone:** `human` or `article`

## Six SEO Smells (identify and fix)

| # | Smell | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | Keyword stuffing (same phrase unnaturally repeated) | 2% density max. Use synonyms, pronouns, natural language |
| 2 | Fake FAQ (generic Q&A, 50-word answers, no real questions) | Delete if FAQ wouldn't exist without the article. Real questions only. |
| 3 | Template skeleton (What is X / Why important / Top 10 / FAQ / Conclusion) | Break the template. Earn structure from content. |
| 4 | "Comprehensive guide" that isn't | Cut every section with no new information. |
| 5 | "Here are the" lists (uniform 2-3 sentence items) | Vary item length. Include surprising entries. At least one item contradicts common advice. |
| 6 | Conclusion that regurgitates | Replace with: clear recommendation, specific next action, or open question. |

## Keyword rules

- Title/H1: keyword once, naturally
- First 100 words: keyword once, if it fits
- At least one H2: if section is literally about that topic
- Total: 4-6 instances per 2000 words (was: 15-24)

## Language-specific SEO notes

**RU:** Yandex (~35% share) penalizes over-optimization harder than Google. Human-sounding text is even MORE important. Queries often phrased as questions.
**EN:** Featured snippets reward clear, concise answers. E-E-A-T is real - signal experience through specifics.
**UK:** Google dominates (~95%). Ukrainian queries longer and more conversational. Avoid RU SEO patterns leaking.
**DE/FR/ES/PT/IT/PL:** Google dominates. Same quality-first principles. Local keyword research patterns apply.

## Output extras
Include META RECOMMENDATIONS (title ≤60 chars, description ≤155 chars, slug), INTERNAL LINKS opportunities, SCHEMA opportunities.

## Pipeline Recommendations
- Likely needed: cleanup (SEO template removal), specificity (article depth), tone (article voice)
- Often skippable: none when SEO structure is involved
- Never skip: proofread
- Note: keyword preservation overrides humanization. Never sacrifice SEO structure for voice.
